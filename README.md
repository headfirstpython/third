## third - The support material for the 3rd Edition of Head First Python

The book assumes you have created a folder called `Learning` which contains most of the Jupyter Notebooks as we well as assorted `*.py` files used in the book. A few additional subfolders exist within `Learning`, namely `swimdata`, `swimdata2`, `webapp`, and `charts`. If you follow along with the book, you'll end up creating the same (or a very similar) folder structure to this one. 

Unlike the folder structure used in the book, this repository is *organised by chapter* to make it easier to find each chapter's files/resources. To ensure the notebooks in the individual chapter folders work, some of the subfolders, source files, and notebooks from `Learning` might be repeated (e.g., `swimdata`, `swimclub.py`, and so on). This shouldn't really be a problem, especially if you are following along with the book and create the required folder structure as you go.  (Hint, hint).

The Everything.zip file contains a compressed archive containing all of the folders/code shown above (should you want a straightforward single-file download option).

### Exploring SQLite data

There are a number of SQLite plugins for VS Code which allow you to view/manipulate your SQLite database files (independently of Python or Jupyter Notebook). That said, we really like Simon Willison's Datasette tool, which you can `pip install` from PyPI.  Learn more [here](https://pypi.org/project/datasette/).

### Supplemental Index Material

Please take a look at the `CodeIndex.pdf` file which includes some supplemental code indexing information.
