## third - The support material for the 3rd Edition of Head First Python

If you need help/support, open a new discussion in the Discussions tab (above) as needed. Before doing so, however, be sure to filter on All previous discussions to check that no other reader has raised the same or similar issue/concern previously. Thanks!

The book assumes you have created a folder called `Learning` which contains most of the Jupyter Notebooks as we well as assorted `*.py` files used in the book. A few additional subfolders exist within `Learning`, namely `swimdata`, `swimdata2`, `webapp`, and `charts`. If you follow along with the book, you'll end up creating the same (or a very similar) folder structure to this one. 

Unlike the folder structure used in the book, this repository is *organised by chapter* to make it easier to find each chapter's files/resources. To ensure the notebooks in the individual chapter folders work, some of the subfolders, source files, and notebooks from `Learning` might be repeated (e.g., `swimdata`, `swimclub.py`, and so on). This shouldn't really be a problem, especially if you are following along with the book and create the required folder structure as you go.  (Hint, hint).

The Everything.zip file contains a compressed archive containing all of the folders/code shown above (should you want a straightforward single-file download option).

### Exploring SQLite data

There are a number of SQLite plugins for VS Code which allow you to view/manipulate your SQLite database files (independently of Python or Jupyter Notebook). That said, we really like Simon Willison's Datasette tool, which you can `pip install` from PyPI.  Learn more [here](https://pypi.org/project/datasette/).

### Supplemental Index Material

Please take a look at the `CodeIndex.pdf` file which includes some supplemental code indexing information.
